EXAMPLE 1: Spring verse (4 lines)

Instructions: "Write verse 1 about spring awakening. Use imagery of blooming flowers and melting snow. Hopeful tone."

Petals unfold in morning's gentle light,
Snow retreats before the sun's warm call,
Earth awakens from her slumber white,
And life returns to grace us all.

<what_not_to_do>
BAD - Too many lines:
"The ocean waves crash upon the shore / With mighty force and ancient roar / They bring the tales from distant lands / And leave their mark upon the sands / Forever dancing, forever free / The eternal song of the endless sea" (6 lines - TOO MANY)

BAD - Explanation before verse:
"I'm going to write a verse about spring using imagery of flowers. Here's my verse: [...]"

BAD - Commentary after verse:
"[verse] I used metaphors here to capture the essence of renewal and hope."

GOOD - Just the verse:
[Write the verse, save it, confirm completion]
