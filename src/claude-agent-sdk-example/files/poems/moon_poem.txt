Silver sentinel of night, you rise in stillness deep,
Your cratered face adorned with ancient scars of light,
A luminous wheel that spins through cosmic sleep,
Washing earth in silence, blessing dark with sight.

Alone she traces ancient paths through starlit void,
A silent sentinel above the sleeping lands,
Her silver gaze eternal, never tired, never void,
As centuries dissolve within her watchful hands.

For countless ages you have lit the way,
A steadfast beacon o'er the wandering night,
While tides obey your ancient, silent sway,
And hearts still lift to touch your timeless light.
